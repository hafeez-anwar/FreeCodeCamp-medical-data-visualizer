# FreeCodeCamp-medical-data-visualizer

This is the solution of the Medical Data Visualizer project of the course Data Science with Python on FREECODECAMP.ORG.

The boilerplate of the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/probability-calculator

My solution can be found at https://replit.com/@HafeezAnwar/boilerplate-medical-data-visualizer-2#medical_data_visualizer.py

By running the main.py, you will see the following where the code successfully passes all the tests in the test module.
